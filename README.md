# questrpg
Little text rpg using python and a SQLite database.

See Projects tab for development and features. Right now the project is a proof of concept. There is no story or content. It is just features and functionality.

Thanks to Jordan G. for the dope text art.

**Running The game:**

download the file and in the directory with the python files run 
>python3 main.py
